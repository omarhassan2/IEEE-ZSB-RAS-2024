# IEEE-ZSB-RAS-Embedded Systems Track-2024

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the IEEE-ZSB-RAS Embedded Systems Track 2024! Here, I'm documenting my journey as I learn about Embedded Systems. In this README file, you'll find an overview of my learning objectives for each task.

## Task Objectives:

### Task 1: Arrays & Pointers 
- The objective of this assignment is to clearly understand and exercise concepts of arrays and pointers and to use them in function implementations to deliver needed output
- The secondary objective is to get to know about strings and how to manipulate them in your code.
